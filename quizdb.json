The laws governing this city’s maritime commerce were codified in the <em>Breve Consulum Maris</em>, which served as a guide for the magistrates of this city. With Genoan assistance, troops from this city expelled the Saracens from Sardinia. This city would later war with Genoa, whose victory over this city at the Battle of (*)</strong> Meloria marked the end of its maritime dominance. Though this city was a staunch supporter of the Ghibellines, it was the location of a church council that elected Alexander V as pope in an attempt to end the Western Schism, which actually ended five years later at the Council of Constance. Despite the victory of this city’s forces at the Battle of Montecatini, Florence assumed the preeminent position in Tuscany, occupying this city in 1406. For 10 points, name this Italian city that Florence surpassed as the commercial center of Tuscany, the birthplace of Galileo Galilei.",

That figure, Dean O’Banion, was murdered in a flower shop in this city after tricking Johnny Torrio. After Torrio retired from crime, he left an organization called this city’s “Outfit” to a protégé who was investigated by a group of Prohibition agents called the Untouchables. Eliot Ness helped bring down that boss of this city, whose associates gunned down seven members of Bugs Moran’s North Side gang in the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre.

A traditional drum wagon in the winner’s army honors Sultan, a Saint Bernard mascot who was gunned down at this battle. After urging peace talks, the losing commander at this battle seems to have tragically misunderstood his monarch’s telegram reply of “has a battle taken place?” to be a savage dig at his cowardice. A contentious stand-off in this battle took place in the (*)</strong> Swieb forest where one side was unable to support their troops with volleys from Masloved hill over fears of friendly fire. Franz Joseph I was forced to sign the Peace of Prague after this battle, which saw Ludwig von Benedek’s muzzle-loading Lorenz rifle outclassed by the breech-loading Dreyse needle gun used by forces under von Moltke the Elder. For 10 points, name this 1866 battle that ended the Austro-Prussian War.",

Berossus is the earliest historical source to mention this location, which was built in his original hometown. Sources frequently named this location after Queen Semiramis (“seh-MEER-uh-miss”), who actually lived at least 200 years before its construction. According to Strabo, an early version of Archimedes’ (*)</strong> Screw was built for use at this location. Archaeologists have yet to find this place, whose name refers to the trees that drooped over its terraces. The Chaldean (“cal-DEE-in”) king Nebuchadnezzar II built this location, which was among the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. For 10 points, name this legendary green space in Babylon.",
